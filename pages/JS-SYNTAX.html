        <h2>JavaScript - Syntax</h2>
        <p id="demo"></p>
        <script>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the < script > ... </ script > HTML tags in a web page.";<br>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "You can place the < script > tags, containing your JavaScript, anywhere within your web page, but it is normally recommended that you should keep it within the < head > tags.";<br>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the < script > ... </ script > HTML tags in a web page.";<br>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "The < script > tag alerts the browser program to start interpreting all the text between these tags as a script.";<br>
        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "A simple syntax of your JavaScript will appear as follows. ";<br>
        </script>

        <h3> The script tag takes two important attributes: </h3>
        <li >   Language: This attribute specifies what scripting language you are using.
                Typically, its value will be javascript. Although recent versions of 
                HTML (and XHTML, its successor) have phased out the use of this attribute.<br><br>
        <li>    Type: This attribute is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting 
                language in use and its value should be set to "text/javascript". 
        </li>       
    </ul>  
    
    <ul style="color: white;" >
        <h3> Whitespace and Line Breaks </h3>
        <li>    JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and newlines that appear in JavaScript programs.
                You can use spaces, tabs, and newlines freely in your program and you are free to 
                format and indent your programs in a neat and consistent way that makes the code easy 
                to read and understand.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul style="color: white;" >
        <h3> Semicolons are Optional </h3>
        <li>    Simple statements in JavaScript are generally followed by a semicolon character, 
                just as they are in C, C++, and Java. JavaScript, however, allows you to omit this 
                semicolon if each of your statements are placed on a separate line.
                For example, the following code could be written without semicolons.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul style="color: white;" >
        <h3> Comments in JavaScript</h3>
        <a>  JavaScript supports both C-style and C++-style comments, Thus: </a> <br>
        <li>    Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by JavaScript.
        <li>    Any text between the characters /* and */ is treated as a comment. This may span multiple lines.           
        <li>    JavaScript also recognizes the HTML comment opening sequence "< ! - -" JavaScript 
                treats this as a single-line comment, just as it does the // comment.          
        <li>    The HTML comment closing sequence --> is not recognized by JavaScript so it should be written as //-->.
        
    </ul>
